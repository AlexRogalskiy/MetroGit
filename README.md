# Metro themed Git UI

A metro themed Git UI tool that's more than just commit and code.

Hey! You've found this repository. ü§ì I am still getting this ready but this will be the home to a (hopefully) very awsome git UI tool...

Ok so we all work with git, commit, push, rebase... blah blah blah, but our work is often more than git right? There's Jenkins, AppVeyor, JIRA and more and more tool we use everyday. What if there's a tool that collects all these useful information in one convenient place? Wouldn't that be awsome? üòä Commit, push your code and track automated test status from your choice of CI, right on your desktop; Check your JIRA ticket, update status and make comment, right next to your commits without switching screen; Switch and work with multiple repository, customize settings for all of them in one convenient app... and so much more 

Excited? Conveniced? This app is coming, stay tuned for more!

TL;DR; How about a sneak peak? üòè...
